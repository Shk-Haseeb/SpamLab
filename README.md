## SpamLab: Spam/Ham Email Classifier

This is a **spam detection app** I built from scratch using real-world email datasets. It classifies emails as **spam or ham** using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. The project helped me explore **text preprocessing, model evaluation, and deploying ML app with Streamlit**.

### What I Learned

- Built multiple classifiers: `Naive Bayes`, `Logistic Regression`, and an `Ensemble Voting Classifier`
- Used `TF-IDF Vectorization` to convert raw email text into numerical features
- Cleaned and processed text using `NLTK`, `regex`, and `pandas`
- Deployed app using **Streamlit Cloud**
- Wrote helper scripts and testing functions
- Set up **CI/CD** using **GitHub Actions** to automatically run test scripts

### Tech Stack

- `Python 3.10`
- `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `nltk`, `re`
- `joblib` for model serialization
- `Streamlit` for app deployment
- `GitHub Actions` for basic testing CI
- `pytest` for test coverage
