# 📧 SpamLab: Spam/Ham Email Classifier

This is a **spam detection app** I built from scratch using real-world email datasets. It classifies emails as **spam or ham** using natural language processing and machine learning. The project helped me explore **text preprocessing, model evaluation, and deploying ML apps with Streamlit**.

## 🚀 What I Learned

- Built multiple classifiers: `Naive Bayes`, `Logistic Regression`, and an `Ensemble Voting Classifier`
- Used `TF-IDF Vectorization` to convert raw email text into numerical features
- Cleaned and processed text using `NLTK`, `regex`, and `pandas`
- Deployed app using **Streamlit Cloud**
- Practiced software structuring with `src/`, `models/`, and modular Python files
- Wrote helper scripts and testing functions
- Set up **CI/CD** using **GitHub Actions** to automatically run test scripts
